  student's queries and teach them by taking classes.
  I played a crucial role in developing a web application for car rentals in my college group project.
   I developed many UI, 
  and backend for the existing website that allowed the users to explore and navigate, 
  and get much more information about their requirements. This website can be used for a user to book a car 
  rental with add-on features. I have used React, spring boot, and SQL for developing this website..</p>
